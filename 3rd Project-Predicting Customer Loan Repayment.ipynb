Checking spelling – Spelling are checked here to ensure that each object is only mentioned once, and if an object is misspelled it will be considered a different value which can lead to misleading results. For instance, other and Other are same conversationally, or even in writing because they convey the same meaning. But even having a slight difference as one being titled and the other being lowercase, it makes them two different things or variables in programming and the same rules apply to DataFrame columns and information it contains."

Most individuals are not able to get away from the government and law if they don’t pay taxes, but governments sometimes make exceptions for companies and big corporations. Hence people who have 1 or more than 1 tax_liens are likely to be an organization instead of a single individual, so all values from 1 and 11 to will be replaced with 1.

    "# 16. Cross Validation – It is helpful to perform cross-validation because in cross validation the entire dataset is trained and tested. Cross validation does kFolds, which are number of Folds and partitions. For instance, if there were 10 kfolds, then the data will be partitioned into 5 subsets. The model will train on subset 1, 2, 3, 4, and test on subset 5. In the next iteration, the model will train on subset 2, 3, 4, 5, and test on subset 1. This will go on for a total of 5 iterations and in doing so the entire dataset will go through training and testing. At the end, testing scores are averaged. This averages out the outliers and noise that could be in a certain state of the data. Cross-validation gives a wholistic picture of the model because the model gets trained and tested on the entire dataset and the cross-validation scores are much more reliable. A person can do as many or as little partitions or kfolds. Generally, 10 folds is considered to be a good number of folds."

    "## Concluding words: Credit score, current loan amount, annual income, and monthly debt were the top 4 important features. From this it can be deduced that if a customer has high credit score and good annual income, they will be likely to pay back the loan. And possibly if a customer has low current loan amount and low monthly debt that also implies that the customer would be able to pay back the loan. This information could assist banks in determining which customers they can approve the loan for because they have the high likelihood of paying back the loan. Further analysis would have to be done to determine minimum amount qualification for annual income and credit score.\n",
    "## Some ways to improve the model would be to construct another model and look closely at credit score and annual income because these two features were missing the same number of values. Another way to make the model better would be to create an ensemble model and use voting classifier to get a vote of each algorithm to make a final prediction. One last thing that could also help is to do oversampling on the final model to ensure that the data is not imbalanced, so there is also high precision and recall. "
